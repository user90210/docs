# TezTok Token Indexer

An indexer that aggregates and normalizes NFT related data on the Tezos Blockchain and provides a GraphQL API for developers. Currently supported marketplaces: hicetnunc, kalamint, teia, objkt.com\*, versum\*\*, fxhash.

The indexer is in an experimental/unstable state and is not meant to be used in production yet. The current goal is to collect some feedback from developers in order to determine if something essential is missing and to find out who would be interested in using it. The idea is to run the indexer as a service and provide the source code on GitHub (but it still needs a bit more polishing first). We would love to hear if you are interested in using the indexer. [You can reach us on Discord](https://discord.gg/KBHxf4RbzC).


## Use cases

* Applications showcasing Tezos NFTs including price information
* Services pushing notifications on mints, swaps or price drops
* Tax software reporting on transactions in specific time frames
* General data analysis on Tezos NFTs

## How it works

The indexer aggregates and stores an event history for all supported tokens. 
Every time a new event occurs on a token, the indexer processes the event history and re-creates a token model along with related models like listings, offers, tags, and holdings. 
Besides that, the indexer fetches the meta data of each token and creates a set of thumbnails.

*Example execution of a GraphQL query in pure JavaScript:*

```javascript
(async () => {
  const rawResponse = await fetch('https://unstable-do-not-use-in-production-api.teztok.com/v1/graphql', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Accept': 'application/json',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      query: `
        query GetLatestSales {
          events(where: {implements: {_eq: "SALE"}}, order_by: {opid: desc}, limit: 100) {
          type
          timestamp
          seller_address
          buyer_address
          price
          token {
              fa2_address
              token_id
              name
              artist_address

          }
        }
      `
    })
  });

  const result = await rawResponse.json();
  console.log(result);
})();
```

## Events

A list of token related events that are currently captured by the indexer.

> **_NOTE:_** You can find out if an event refers to a sale by checking if it has an *implements* property set to *SALE*. All events which implement the *SALE* interface are guaranteed to have *fa2_address*, *token_id*, *seller_address*, *buyer_address*, and *price* properties. This can be useful to calculate things like 24h volume.

**FA2_TRANSFER**

*A token got transferred from one address to another.*
